# Overview of Project 
Developed an interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize a comprehensive dataset on the microbial composition of human navels. The findings indicated that a limited number of microbial species (designated as operational taxonomic units or OTUs) were widely present in over 70% of participants, while the remainder were less frequent. 

# Purpose
Illustrated the diversity of operational taxonomic units in the dataset by creating interactive visualizations using JavaScript, enabling an in-depth examination of the microbial composition of human navels. 

# Requirements 
VS Code and Web browser (Chrome). 

# Data Visualizations 

Designed and developed a Belly-Button Dashboard to showcase the diversity of operational taxonomic units present in the dataset, providing an interactive and user-friendly platform for exploring the microbial composition of human navels.

Created a dynamic horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu feature, including demographic variables allowing the user to visualize the top 10 operational taxonomic units found in individual subjects based on their ID number, providing a comprehensive and intuitive representation of the microbial composition of human navels.

Developed an interactive bubble chart that represents each sample's operational taxonomic unit composition, showcasing the OTU ID, abundance, and additional details such as sample labels upon hovering.

Lastly, implemented a gauge chart to showcase the weekly washing frequency of individual subjects, adapted from the Plotly JavaScript library's gauge chart feature (https://plotly.com/javascript/gauge-charts/). This dynamic visualization offers a clear and concise representation of the subjects' hygiene habits, further enriching the insights gained from the analysis of the microbial composition of human navels.
